            <p>The course tasked my group with coming up with solutionsto an existing issue. Buffer was an idea we formed on the idea of community,
                of how people will always need a shared space in which 
                they are able to express themselves.
                Through trial and error, and listening to potential consumers
                Buffer was able to maintain its roots, and serve the community.</p>

                    We looked at other apps that were already on the market that had similar ideas as Buffer. We found that while many of the other apps were highly specialized towards cataloging or recommendations, very few dared to combine the two. And even fewer had the notion of creating a watch party forum. While I presented the idea that the app be used as a means to keep things better organized cross streaming platforms. Other members of my group are truly to thank for coming up with the ideas towards including watch parties.

              <p class="lead">The issue that we were finding with our users was that they felt as if they had less of a third space to connect with their friends. Which caused distance and isolation issues. Savannah, one of our team members was able to gather this great quote during her research of Dr. Laurie Santos "Sharing a good experience deepens enjoyment of the moment." And that's what Buffer at its core wishes to create. A good experience.</p>

                Our sketches were done by all our team members. We tried to combine a variety of our ideas in order to create something that would address different issues our users gave us in previous sections.

                Once we we landed on an agreed upon image. We started creating the skeleton of what the app should look like. It was during this phase that we did further testing in order to see if we were capturing users image of what a movie community app should be.

                We had to recreate the prototype quite a bit, to get every landing page correct. As we were trying to introduce different things that didn't always connect. But trusting the data collected from users, we continued to work on this as we believed it was worth effort to create a good experience for users.
